# springboot-docker-project

This is a Spring Boot application that demonstrates how to containerize a Java-based application using Docker. The project includes the necessary configuration files to build and run the application within a Docker container, simplifying the deployment process.

The application is built using **Spring Boot**, a popular Java framework, and can be easily run locally or in a cloud environment using Docker. The Docker container ensures that the application runs consistently across different environments, making it ideal for scalable and production-ready deployments.
